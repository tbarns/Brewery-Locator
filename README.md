## About this Project: 
I was tasked to create a project with a group.  After completing an MVP collaboratively I forked the existing project and worked on implementing more features and getting the UI to be more polished.  Below is a description of the original project as envisioned by my team.

As a group, we decided that finding breweries should be as easy as clicking a button. So we wanted to create a simple user interface that grabs data about breweries and their location. Upon retrieving location results our user is presented with search results that tell you what the breweries in the area have to offer and given the option to navigate to the brewery.
As a group, we are responsible for this entire application from the crafting of the HTML, CSS, and Javascript files.  Below there is more information about the process and technologies used but this concept and creation is unique to the collaboration between the members of the team
